# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
I did an investigations on Sales data using RStudio to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypothesis and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

I have attached the RMD and html file of my EDA which contains all the code and the explanation of the steps. Furthermore, I have also attached the pptx file which contains all the bussiness questions that you can answer using the exploratory data analysis HTML file.
